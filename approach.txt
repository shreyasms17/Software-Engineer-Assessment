## Approach


#### Question 1
A class ProcessGameState was created with class variables 
    1. bounding_polygon which describes outer points the light blue area denoting the choke area
    2. game_state_df, a dataframe placeholder to hold the dataframe
    3. input parquet file path

The class methods include:
    1. read_input, that reads the input parquet file into the game_state_df dataframe
    2. check_in_choke_area, that checks if a particular coordinate falls inside the choke area
    3. compute_row_position, which checks if a row in the dataframe is inside the choke area or not and creates a boolean column in game_state_df called 'in_choke_area'
    4. get_weapon_classes, that adds a weapon_class column by exploding the inventory column and creating a row for each weapon carried by a player at a given point of time
    5. get_processed_game_state, returns the processed game state dataframe
